This project aims to create a suite of scripts to display spotlight comments
tags and files from the command line.

I want to do the following:

- list tags by usage
- list files and paths by tags
- open a given file
- search by boolean tagging
- add a tag to a given file
- remove a tag from a give file
- list by tag and date modified
- pass a string for searching within files and tags
- make tag relations
